# Trifivend AI Coldcaller Bot

 A full-stack AI-powered coldcalling system featuring Ava from Trifivend. It uses OpenAI GPT-4o, ElevenLabs, Whisper, and Twilio to contact, engage, and log leads automatically.

## Features
- üß† GPT-4o logic for intelligent calling and responses
- üó£Ô∏è ElevenLabs voice for ultra-humanlike responses
- üîä Whisper-based mic input handling (CLI + Web)
- üìû Twilio outbound voice calling and webhook response
- üõ† FastAPI backend with Supabase integration
- üåê Web interface for local simulation and testing
- üöÄ Fly.io deployable backend and full infrastructure config

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot you will need accounts and API keys for:

- **OpenAI** ‚Äì used for GPT-4o responses.
- **ElevenLabs** ‚Äì text-to-speech voice generation.
- **Supabase** ‚Äì optional logging of conversations.
- **Twilio** ‚Äì outbound phone calls. Purchase or verify a phone number and, if on a
  trial account, [verify the destination number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#verify-an-outbound-caller-id).

You also need **Python 3.10+** and `git` installed locally.

If Twilio is going to call a server running on your machine, you must expose it to the
internet (for example by using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or by deploying to Fly.io).

## Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Setup

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd Trifivend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file from the provided example and fill in all required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key variables and what they are for:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äì OpenAI API key.
- `OPENAI_MODEL` ‚Äì model to use (default `gpt-4`).
- `ELEVEN_API_KEY` ‚Äì ElevenLabs API key for TTS.
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` ‚Äì optional Supabase logging.
- `TWILIO_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` ‚Äì found in the Twilio console under
  **Account > Keys & Credentials**.
- `TWILIO_NUMBER` ‚Äì the Twilio phone number making calls.
- `LEAD_PHONE` ‚Äì the phone number to dial (E.164 format, e.g. `+15551234567`).
- `APP_BASE_URL` ‚Äì base URL of your deployed app used for serving audio files.
- `VOICE_WEBHOOK_URL` ‚Äì public URL for the bot's voice webhook. When running locally
  you can tunnel your dev server with `ngrok http 8080` and set this to
  `https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/twilio-voice`. If deployed on Fly, use the Fly domain
  (e.g. `https://your-app.fly.dev/twilio-voice`).

### 3. Start the backend service

The backend exposes the `/twilio-voice` endpoint that Twilio calls during outbound
calls. Launch it with:

```bash
./run_dev.sh
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:8080`. Ensure it is reachable from the public
internet at the URL specified by `VOICE_WEBHOOK_URL`.

### 4. Run the Streamlit interface

Launch an interactive UI that supports text input, audio recording or upload, and streams AI replies:

```bash
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```

The app posts your message to the `/transcribe` endpoint, streams incremental updates from `/mcp/sse`, plays the generated audio reply, and keeps a timestamped conversation history in the sidebar.

### 5. (Optional) Open the web simulator

There is a simple frontend for local testing:

```bash
cd ../frontend
open index.html
```

### 6. Place an outbound call

With the backend running and `VOICE_WEBHOOK_URL` pointing to it, initiate a call to
`LEAD_PHONE`:

```bash
python twilio/outbound_call.py
```

## Making Cold Calls for Vending Machine Leads

To launch the dialer for your vending machine business, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies** ‚Äì create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables** ‚Äì copy the example file and populate it with your API keys and phone numbers:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Important variables include `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVEN_API_KEY`, `TWILIO_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_NUMBER`, `LEAD_PHONE`, `APP_BASE_URL`, and `VOICE_WEBHOOK_URL`.

3. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   ./run_dev.sh
   ```

4. **Initiate outbound cold calls** using the Twilio helper script:

   ```bash
   python twilio/outbound_call.py
   ```



## Deploy to Fly.io

To run the bot in production on Fly.io and obtain a stable public URL:

```bash
cd deploy
./deploy.sh
```
